            I had never known a day without Luka. From the moment my parents brought home that clumsy little red heeler pup — paws too big for his body, eyes full of mischief — he was just… there. A part of me. We grew up together, speaking this unspoken language of tail wags, glances, and quiet moments.

            I can still see his copper coat, speckled with pale spots that caught the sunlight. His eyes always followed me, ready for the next walk, the next game, or just to sit beside me in silence. He was sturdy, built to run alongside my bike for hours or trot with me across paddocks without a single complaint.

            Some memories feel sharper than others. The winter night by the fireplace — I was reading, and he was curled at my feet, his fur glowing in the firelight. Every so often, he'd glance up at me, thump his tail, like he was saying, “I'm here.” That's enough.

            Or that cold morning when I was fixing my old white Falcon. Luka stood nearby, ears pricked, watching like he understood. His tail swayed in a slow rhythm, just happy to be with me.

            And then… the golden afternoon in the park. The sun was low, the grass warm, and I was crouched with a tennis ball in my hand. Luka sat so still, eyes locked on the ball, muscles ready to spring. The second I moved, he shot forward, pure joy in motion.

            But he grew old. Walks got shorter. His run turned into careful steps. Soft white fur crept around his muzzle. And one quiet afternoon at the vet's, he lay in my lap, breathing slower and slower as I whispered, “Good boy… good boy…” until that was the only sound left.

            The apartment was too quiet after that. His leash still hung by the door. The bowl stayed in the corner. What scared me most wasn't the silence — it was forgetting. The smell of his fur after a day outside. The sound of his bark across the yard. The way he leaned against me.

            That's when I turned to my EVOKE watch. I'd worn it for years, not realising it had been recording so many moments with him. The first playback was like a punch to the chest — I was back in the park, the air warm, the scent of earth in the breeze, Luka's low growl rumbling through my palm as I held the ball.

            I got lost in those recordings. Luka by the fire. Luka in the driveway. Luka running in the park. Every detail was there — the light, the sound, even the way the grass felt under my hand. But the more I played them, the more the real world faded. Food had no taste. People's voices felt thin. Why live in a world without Luka when I could step into one where he still existed?

            That was the moment I realised how deeply technology can change the way we deal with loss. EVOKE wasn't just a watch. It was a doorway. A way to bend time and bring the past into the present with frightening precision. At first, it felt like a gift — a way to keep Luka close. But I started to see how easily it could become a trap.

            The problem is, memory in real life is imperfect. It fades, blurs, and distorts over time. That's part of what makes it human. Forgetting, as painful as it is, forces us to move forward.

            EVOKE removed that barrier. It gave me a perfect version of Luka — untouched by age or death — and once I had that, reality felt inadequate.

            I think this is where the danger lies: when a memory becomes more vivid than the present, it's hard to come back. The brain doesn't separate “then” from “now” when the sensory details are exact. The scent of the grass, the sound of his paws hitting the ground, the weight of him leaning against me — it wasn't just remembering, it was being there. And once you've been there again, it's hard to accept that you can't stay.

            But I also wonder — is this really any different from what humans have always done? We've always looked for ways to hold on. First it was stories. Then photographs. Then videos. Each step brought us closer to reliving the past. EVOKE just happens to be the step where we can actually step back inside it.

            And maybe that's the real shift: the line between remembering and living is no longer clear. The question isn't just “should we look back” — it's “how much time should we spend there?” I'm still figuring out my answer.

            Because the truth is, part of me knows I can't stay in those moments forever. But another part… the part that still hears Luka's bark in my sleep… doesn't want to leave at all.
